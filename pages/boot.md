I figured this one would go without saying, however definitely wanted to cover it. If I have to reboot something after starting it up for it operate properly, it's not truly a first boot.

As an engineer, you tend to try and look at the facts before doing something drastic. Whatever is going on under the hood here is not something you would expect to encounter, nor is giving the box a kick to permanently fix the issue expected at all.
