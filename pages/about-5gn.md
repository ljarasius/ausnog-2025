<!--
For those in the room that haven't heard of us, no the 5G doesn't stand for _that_ 5G.

5G Networks is a telco with a full suite of traditional services, operating a MPLS network spanning the coast of Australia from Brisbane to Perth, as well as New Zealand, Singapore and the United States.

On top of your usual culprits like transit and intercapital services, we operate an optical network to underpin this connectivity, offering wavelength services on major domestic and international routes. We also have our own dark fibre network in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, connecting into our own data centre facilities.

As part of our recent acquisition of AUCyber, we have a bolstered cloud and managed services offering, as well as bringing cyber security into the folds of our product set across the broader group.
