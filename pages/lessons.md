# Lessons learned

- Test as early in the cycle as possible
- Expect things to go wrong, and go looking to prove otherwise
- Simulate real failure conditions
- Engage with industry peers for new perspectives

There's a few important things we have taken away from this.

First of all, try not to leave testing until things are further down the track. Break things early, and see what happens. Definitely try and get to it before you have production traffic involved.

Secondly, expect that breaking it will fail spectacularly, and go looking into the logs and output to prove otherwise.

Thirdly, try your best to simulate what a failure could look like in the real world. Whether that is someone unplugging a cable, removing a VLAN or power-cycling a device, the more realistic the more likely you will be to find something wrong.

Lastly, reach out to your peers, many of whom might be in this room, and talk about what problems you're trying to solve and the issues you are facing. There's some amazing people here, and even if you're just looking for validation that you're not completely insane with an approach to a problem, it makes us all better engineers to learn from others success, and failures too.
