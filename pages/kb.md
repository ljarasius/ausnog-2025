<!--
And now we have this knowledge base article, immortalised on the internet! Want to fix this issue if you hit it? Restart the PPM daemon, or reboot the box. Fixed. Gone. Won't come back on the software installation you're running.

This bug only affects the first boot on an affected version, which had never even occurred to us that something like this was possible before going down this rabbit hole. Surely, after upgrading a device and it boots into the OS, it should be the same as every subsequent boot? Apparently that isn't always the case.

Is only 21.2R3-S2 affected? We don't think so, and the final line sums it up. How this issue is fixed in newer release is unidentified. Let's hope we don't see this one again in a newer version.
