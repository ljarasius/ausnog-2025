Would like to give a quick shout out to Sohan and Alain at Juniper for all their assistance on this one, as well as to the rest of the Engineering team at 5G Networks and the BBL crew for putting up with my rants about this.

I've also published this entire talk to GitHub at the link on the screen, feel free to have a look there if there's anything you missed earlier or for those links.

Thank you.
